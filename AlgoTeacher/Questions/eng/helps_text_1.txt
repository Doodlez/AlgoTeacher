Thus, the two matrices A and B PxQ size MxN and respectively.
You multiply if and only if, when number of columns of the
first array matches the number of rows of the second, i.e. Q=M.
Every final element of the matrix C will be from sum
of the products of matrix elements appropriate rows
of the matrix A and a column of the matrix B.
